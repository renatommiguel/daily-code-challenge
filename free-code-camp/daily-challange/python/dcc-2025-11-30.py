AI Detector
Today's challenge is inspired by the release of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022.

Given a string of one or more sentences, determine if it was likely generated by AI using the following rules:

It contains two or more dashes (-).

It contains two or more sets of parenthesis (()). Text can be within the parenthesis.

It contains three or more words with 7 or more letters.

Words are separated by a single space and only consist of letters (A-Z). Don't include punctuation or other non-letters as part of a word.

If the given sentence meets any of the rules above, return "AI", otherwise, return "Human".

Tests
Waiting:1. detect_ai("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.") should return "Human".
Waiting:2. detect_ai("The hypersonic brown fox - jumped (over) the lazy dog.") should return "Human".
Waiting:3. detect_ai("Yes - you're right! I made a mistake there - let me try again.") should return "AI".
Waiting:4. detect_ai("The extraordinary students were studying vivaciously.") should return "AI".
Waiting:5. detect_ai("The (excited) student was (coding) in the library.") should return "AI".
